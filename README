Automaton
----

This is a simple 2D cellular automaton as described by Stephen Wolfram's "A
New Kind of Science," written in Java.

The implementation takes an array of cells, represented as `int[]`, where
"empty cells" contain a value of 0 and `filled cells` contain a value of 1.

The automaton creates a new generation by accepting a pattern, represented
as a value between 0 and 255. The pattern describes the generation by
providing the generated value for a given octet.
